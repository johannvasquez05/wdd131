            <p>Hi! My name is Johann Vasquez, and I'm from Panama City, Panama. I've always been fascinated by how
                technology works and the ways it can be used to solve real-world problems. That curiosity led me to
                study software development at BYU, where I’m learning how to bring ideas to life through code.

                What I enjoy most is creating things that people can actually use — like websites or apps that are
                helpful, easy to navigate, and look great. It’s exciting to see a project go from a simple idea to
                something real that others can interact with. I'm especially drawn to web development because it's such
                a creative and constantly evolving space.

                I also enjoy working with others, whether it’s on class projects or something more informal. There’s
                always something new to learn from different perspectives, and collaboration often leads to better
                results. Outside of school, I like keeping up with what's new in tech, whether it's a new app, tool, or
                trend that’s shaping the future.

                My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who not only writes good code but also understands
                people’s needs and how technology can meet them. One day, I hope to start something of my own — maybe a
                company or a project that makes a positive difference. I'm excited for what’s ahead and motivated to
                keep learning, growing, and building along the way.

            <img class="panama" src="images/panama.webp" alt="Panama City">
            <p>My home, Panama City, is a symphony of vibrant life. The tropical sun glints off the glass
                towers of its modern skyline, while below, weathered fishermen mend their nets along the bustling
                waterfront. Just a short walk away, the Casco Viejo—the old town—unfolds in a cascade of cobblestone
                streets, pastel-colored colonial buildings, and lively plazas filled with the aroma of sizzling
                empanadas.</p>
