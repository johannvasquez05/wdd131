            <p>Hi! My name is Johann Vasquez, and I'm from Panama City, Panama. I have a deep passion
                for computers and
                programming, especially exploring new technologies and solving complex problems through code. I’m
                currently
                studying software development at BYU, and I’m constantly amazed by how much there is to learn and
                the
                endless possibilities technology offers.I'm particularly excited about web development and understanding
                how web pages function behind the scenes. I
                want to master building dynamic, user-friendly applications. Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating on
                projects, learning from others, and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
                My goal is to become a well-rounded developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and maybe even launch
                my
                own startup one day. The tech field is always evolving, and I love the challenge of keeping up with new
                advancements. Whether it's debugging code, designing interfaces, or optimizing performance, I find every
                aspect of development fascinating. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me and the impact I can
                make
                in the digital world!

            <img class="panama" src="images/panama.webp" alt="Panama City">
            <p>My home, Panama City, is a symphony of vibrant life. The tropical sun glints off the glass
                towers of its modern skyline, while below, weathered fishermen mend their nets along the bustling
                waterfront. Just a short walk away, the Casco Viejo—the old town—unfolds in a cascade of cobblestone
                streets, pastel-colored colonial buildings, and lively plazas filled with the aroma of sizzling empanadas.</p>
